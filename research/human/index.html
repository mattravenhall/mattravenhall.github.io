<h2>Overview</h2>
<img style="float: right; border: 1px solid black" alt="Yakult Poster" hspace="20" src="/assets/highlightHuman.png">
<p>Genetic variation has been demonstrated to provide individuals with protection against severe malaria, for example through the malaria-protective effect of heterozygous carriage of the sickle cell anaemia allele.<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3269803/">[1]</a></sup> My research aims to better understand these variants, and to identify further variants and selection events which may better inform our understanding of malaria.</p>
