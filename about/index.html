<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Matt Ravenhall. Currently, a PhD student within the <a href="http://pathogenseq.lshtm.ac.uk">PathogenSeq</a> group at the <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/ravenhall.matt">LSHTM</a>.<br>
In my free time I tackle data science projects, communicate science and listen to all the podcasts.</p>

	My research interests primarily concern genetic diversity within a global malaria context. Currently I focus on the impact of a range of genetic variation within human and <i>Plasmodium</i> (the causal parasite family for malaria) populations. These variants can take multiple forms but I have a particular interest in the distribution and selection of those ranging from small single base variants to larger structural variants (deletions, duplications etc.).

	A selection of my published work can be found in the <a href="/publications">publications</a> page with specific deep dives also appearing in the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section.

	In my spare time, I like to hone my data science skills through a range of side projects. I hold a particular interest in applying 'from scratch' machine learning methods such as <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall/BasicNeuralNetwork">neural networks</a> and natural language processing. Recently I completed an internship within the financial data science industry, during which I built automated anomaly detection and rule inference engines.

	Discussion of some of these projects will take place within the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section, and source code can usually be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall">github</a>.

	I also hold a keen interest in science communication. Previously, I led the creation of a student science magazine <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/incubator/spark-magazine-student-science-magazine-of-york-university">Spark</a> during my undergraduate, and have dabbled in podcast production (such as with the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mendels-finches">Mendal's Finches</a>) podcast. My writing has appeared in <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110485-our-ice-age-ancestors-skinned-cave-lions-to-make-roofs-for-huts/">NewScientist</a> and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/incubator/spark-magazine-student-science-magazine-of-york-university">Scientific American</a> and I previously served as a student representative on the ABSW board.

	Links to some of my communication work can be found via the <a href="/projects">project</a> page.
