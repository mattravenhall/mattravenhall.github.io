<p>Hi, I'm Matt Ravenhall. Computational Biologist, Data Scientist & Science Communicator.<br>
Currently, I work as a PhD student at <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/ravenhall.matt">LSHTM</a> within the <a href="http://pathogenseq.lshtm.ac.uk">PathogenSeq</a> group.<br>
Outside of the lab I enjoy data science projects, science writing and listening to all the podcasts.</p>
