<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Matt Ravenhall. Currently, a PhD student within the <a href="http://pathogenseq.lshtm.ac.uk">PathogenSeq</a> group at the <a href="https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/aboutus/people/ravenhall.matt">LSHTM</a>.<br>
In my free time I tackle data science projects, communicate science and listen to all the podcasts.</p>

	<i>Computational Biologist</i><br>
	My research interests primarily concern genetic diversity within a global malaria context. Currently my work focuses upon the impact of a range of genetic variation within human and <i>Plasmodium</i> (the causal parasite for malaria) populations. These genetic variations can take multiple forms but I have a particular interest in the distribution and selection of those ranging from small single base variants to larger structural variants (deletions, duplications etc.).

	A selection of my published work can be found in the <a href="/publications">publications page with specific deep dives also appearing in the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section.</a>

	<i>Data Scientist</i><br>
	In my spare time, I like to hone my data science skills through a range of side projects. I hold a particular interest in applying 'from scratch' machine learning methods such as neural networks or natural language processing.

	Discussion of some of these projects will take place within the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section, and source code can usually be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall">github</a>.

	<i>Science Communicator</i><br>
	When not writing code, I can often be found communicating science. This interest began during my undergraduate, where I led the creation of a studence science magazine <a href="xxx">Spark</a>, and has since extended into podcast production such as <a href="xxx">Mendal's Finches</a>. My writing has previously appeared in NewScientist and Scientific American and I previously served as a student representative on the ABSW board.

	Links to some of my communication work can be found via the <a href="/projects">project</a> page.
