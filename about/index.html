<p>Hi I'm Matt Ravenhall, currently a Life Science Specialist at <a href="https://www.linguamatics.com/">Lingumatics</a>. I also recently completed a PhD in host-pathogen malaria genomics at the LSHTM</a>. In my free time I tackle data science projects, communicate science and listen to all the podcasts.</p>

<h3>Bioinformatics</h3>
<p>
	My research interests primarily concerned genetic diversity within a global malaria context, specifically the impact of a range of genetic variation within human and <i>Plasmodium</i> (the causal parasite family for malaria) populations. These variants can take multiple forms but I applied a specific focus upon the distribution and selection of those ranging from small single base variants to larger structural variants (deletions, duplications etc.). A selection of my published work can be found in the <a href="/publications">publications</a> page with specific deep dives also appearing in the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section.

<h3>Data Science</h3>
<p>
	I like to hone my data science skills through a variety of side projects and hold a particular interest in applying 'from scratch' machine learning methods such as <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall/BasicNeuralNetwork">neural networks</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall/TweetSentiment">natural language processing</a>. During my PhD I completed a financial data science internship, within which I built automated anomaly detection and rule inference engines. Discussion of some of these projects will take place within the <a href="/blog">blog</a> section, and source code can usually be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mattravenhall">github</a>.

<h3>Science Communication</h3>
<p>
	Every now and then I take to science communication. This has meant leading the creation of a student science magazine <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/incubator/spark-magazine-student-science-magazine-of-york-university">Spark</a> during my undergraduate, a dabbling in podcast production (such as with the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/mendels-finches">Mendal's Finches</a>) podcast, and some of my writing appearing in <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2110485-our-ice-age-ancestors-skinned-cave-lions-to-make-roofs-for-huts/">NewScientist</a> and <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/incubator/spark-magazine-student-science-magazine-of-york-university">Scientific American</a>. Links to some of my communication work can be found via the <a href="/projects">project</a> page.
