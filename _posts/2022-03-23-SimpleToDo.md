I recently went searching for a straight-forward in-browser to-do list, but found that all the options were loaded with tons of features and faff that I didn't really need.

Enter [SimpleToDo](https://github.com/mattravenhall/SimpleToDo), the straight-forward, no-frills, in-browser to-do list. Developed in less than 24 hours, this browser extension allows you to add/remove/edit/check/uncheck list items, supports local and cloud sync, and is open source.

It's also been a great excuse to try out Chromium browser extension development (which is actually surprisingly easy).

You can check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattravenhall/SimpleToDo). Though be warned that I've not touched Javascript in a long time, so the code may be hideous.

## Installation
If you want to try it out, your best bet is to:

1. `git clone https://github.com/mattravenhall/SimpleToDo.git`
2. Open a Chromium-based browser (Chrome, Brave, etc.)
3. Navigate to `Extensions` ➡️ `Developer mode` ➡️ `Load unpacked` ➡️ Select the repo directory
