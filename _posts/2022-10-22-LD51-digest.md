[Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com/) is perhaps *the* classic virtual [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam), and one in which I've previously partipated as part of small teams ([LD29](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225162234/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-29/?action=preview&uid=23029), [LD31](https://web.archive.org/web/20200811184618/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-31/?action=preview&uid=23029)).

After the success of [Signals](https://mattravenhall.github.io/2022/09/13/Signals-Walkthrough.html), the latest Ludum Dare (LD51) was a great opportunity for my first totally solo entry: [A Little Bit Of Everything](https://mattravenhall.itch.io/a-little-bit-of-everything).

## The Idea
This time the theme was "Every 10 Seconds" which, to me, meant rapid minigames with ten second timers. This being heavily inspired by classics such as [WarioWare](https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/WarioWare_(series)) and [The Impossible Quiz](https://poki.com/en/g/the-impossible-quiz).

Building the initial framework only took a few hours with the majority of time being spent brainstorming and building a variety of puzzles that involve finding, calculating, platforming, or just accurately reading simple instructions.

Two key elements emerged during this process:

1. Balance increasing difficulty with randomisation by grouping puzzles by difficulty
2. Mix positive (do X) and negative (don't do X) puzzles to keep the player on their toes

## Feedback
Initial feedback was really positive, and it was a nice surprise to see that people were finding the game fun to play.

This was reflected in the final rankings:

| Category | Rank | Score (out of 5) |
| :------: | :--: | :--------------: |
| Overall | 581 | 3.523 |
| Fun | 234 | 3.785 |
| Innovation | 724 | 3.168 |
| Theme | 262 | 3.991 |
| Graphics | 1034 | 2.687 |
| Humor | 301 | 3.382 |
| Mood | 728 | 3.291 |

Getting 581<sup>th</sup> overall isn't too shabby, and I'm pretty pleased about getting 234<sup>th</sup> in the Fun category. The score for Graphics was fairly mediocre, but that's to be expected when they essentially consist of bright green shapes. Something to be improved in the future!

## Next steps
My plan now is to produce a small post-jam update that:

- Boosts randomisation in some levels
- Fixes some bugs
- Adds a couple more levels

You can play *A Little Bit Of Everything* now on [itch.io](https://mattravenhall.itch.io/a-little-bit-of-everything).
