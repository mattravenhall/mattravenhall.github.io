**Background**
Genetic structural variation underpins a multitude of phenotypes, with significant implications for a range of biological outcomes. Despite their crucial role, structural variants (SVs) are often neglected and overshadowed by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are used in large-scale analysis such as genome-wide association and population genetic studies.
<br>
**Results**
To facilitate the high-throughput analysis of structural variation we have developed an analytical pipeline and visualisation tool, called SV-Pop. The utility of this pipeline was then demonstrated through application with a large, multi-population P. falciparum dataset.
<br>
**Conclusions**
Designed to facilitate downstream analysis and visualisation post-discovery, SV-Pop allows for straightforward integration of multi-population analysis, method and sample-based concordance metrics, and signals of selection.
